# Gill-Site
A fully responsive landing page intro to me. A portion of the markup and jQuery were used from a course by Brad Traversy, but majority of markup code and design is my own.  The goal was just to have a clean, simple landing page introducing myself, what I do, and a section displaying my portfolio projects.
